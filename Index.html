  <h1>Luke Bleeser (S3782106)</h1><br><br>
  <p>My name is Luke Bleeser and I was born and raised in country Victoria, before moving to Melbourne to begin my Bachelor of Electrical and Electronic Engineering (Honours) in 2019.<br>
  I completed high school in a small country town, and I love to spend time outside exploring the countryside. An interesting fact about me is that I live on a beef cattle farm about 4 hours north east of Melbourne!<br>
  My interest in IT began initially with an interest in all things electrical as a young boy, hence my bachelor revolving around the topic.<br> My interest stems from the ever growing daily need to integrate and utilise IT as it becomes more and more entrenched into our daily lives.<br>
  I do not have a lot of experience in IT and have developed most of my basic programming skills throughout my bachelorâ€™s degree (C, C++, MATLAB).
  I do however wish to increase my knowledge in the area as I find it extremely interesting and relevant to a lot of work done in everyday life.<br><br>

  <h1>Radhika Chopra (S3873355) </h1><br><br>
  <p>Born in Melbourne, I am of Indian descent, and currently work as an ESL teacher in regional Victoria. I got interested in IT during my highschool years playing around with website coding and design in my spare time.<br>
    As of today, I have around 7 months of experience working for a small digital startup in Melbourne where I worked on copywriting and SEO, digital marketing, data analysis, and web development.<br>
    With my learned skills, and as part of (group name) I hope to bring together my love of the environment and education, to create technological solutions for the future.<br>
    When I am at home, I love playing with my dogs, being creative, and spending time at the beach.<br><br>
