  <h2>Luke Bleeser (S3782106)</h2><br><br>
  <p>My name is Luke Bleeser and I was born and raised in country Victoria, before moving to Melbourne to begin my Bachelor of Electrical and Electronic Engineering (Honours) in 2019.<br>
  I completed high school in a small country town, and I love to spend time outside exploring the countryside. An interesting fact about me is that I live on a beef cattle farm about 4 hours north east of Melbourne!<br>
  My interest in IT began initially with an interest in all things electrical as a young boy, hence my bachelor revolving around the topic.<br> My interest stems from the ever growing daily need to integrate and utilise IT as it becomes more and more entrenched into our daily lives.<br>
  I do not have a lot of experience in IT and have developed most of my basic programming skills throughout my bachelor’s degree (C, C++, MATLAB).
  I do however wish to increase my knowledge in the area as I find it extremely interesting and relevant to a lot of work done in everyday life.<br><br>

      <h1>Xavier Occhipinti (S3658061)</h1><br><br>
      <p> Hi, my name is Xavier, I am 22 years old and live between Melbourne and Warrnambool. I was born in New Zealand and moved all around for my dad’s work, before settling down in Warrnambool where I grew up most of my life.<br>
         My father is Italian, hence the tricky last name, whilst my mother is Australian. I enjoy playing sports such as basketball, tennis, and soccer. <br>
         I also spend my time playing guitar and piano or getting hooked on video games.</p><br><br>
