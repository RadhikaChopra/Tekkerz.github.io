      <h2>Common elements</h2>
      <p>Our chosen roles for the most part involve the core development & production of either programs or games. Additionally, from the table above it can be inferred that being familiar with various coding languages is imperative.<br>
         Another common denominator is teamwork & communication, which are quite essential in any work place to ensure everyone is aware of daily goals, and tasks that need to be done to create a synergistic workplace environment. <br>
         Generally speaking, the listed jobs all test a wide array of employee skills, and it can be said that a commonality amongst these jobs is a higher technical ability coupled with exceptional people skills.</p>
