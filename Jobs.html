    <h1>Comparing our ideal jobs...</h1>
    <div class="comparisons">

    <h2>Comparing our chosen career paths</h2>
  <p>The roles for the most part involve the core development & production of either programs or games. Additionally, from the table above it can be inferred that being familiar with various coding languages is a necessity in the IT industry.<br>
     Another common denominator is teamwork & communication, which is quite essential in any work place to ensure everyone is aware of daily goals and tasks that need to be done to create a synergistic workplace environment.<br>
      Generally speaking, the listed jobs all test a wide array of employee skills, it can be said that a commonality amongst these jobs is a high & diverse skill set requirement.</p>

<p>The salaries have quite a significant range when comparing the jobs, ranging from $64,000 AUD to $88,000 AUD. This is highly dependent on the role, whether it is at an entry or expert level. <p>
  For example, the project manager role has a base salary of $88,814, as it is a lead position within certain industries. On the other hand, the salary for a game developer is $64,000, as you are typically employed amongst other game developers working on the same project.<br>
   Whilst there are also a lot of common skills amongst the listed jobs, in a way, they are generally expected to be executed differently.</p>

<p>For example, a junior software engineer & game designer both require proficiency in programming languages, however, they would utilise the languages differently. i.e. a game developer would use said languages to design and develop visual & functional aspects of a game, usually for a company with set expectations, or even as a project for themselves if they are an indie game developer.<br>
   On the other hand, a software engineer would utilise the same language for visual and functional aspects for a variety of applications & programs based usually on client/industry specifications.</p>

<p>On the topic of a high and diverse skill set requirement, another notable difference is the minimum qualifications required to be considered for the listed careers. Ranging from an advanced diploma to a masters degree.<br>
   There is a direct correlation between minimum qualification and the expected salary for fulfilling a certain job. Another diversity amongst the listed jobs is that some require you to work well in either a team or on your own.<br>
  Both are essential to any IT workspace as it demonstrates that you are fully capable of executing requirements on your own but are still able to collaborate with others efficiently & progressively.</p>

<p>As a general statement, whilst there are a handful of differences amongst the above career paths, they all in some way or form intertwine and correlate. 5 people can have the same skills, but they can all be executed in a diversity of ways. </p>
