<h1>Modern IT</h1>



<div class="tech1">
  <h1>Cloud, services, servers</h1>
  <h2>What does it do? </h2>
    <p>Cloud services, and servers is a very broad area relating to data transfer and storage through either a physical or virtual server. Both services are a way to process and store data in varying applications. State of the art technology for both types vary and are classified by many factors e.g. Size of storage, cybersecurity, speed, and ease of access.<br>
       Physical servers have been around now for a long period of time and are used to store anything from data to media all the way down to web servers. Cloud servers are however a much newer phenomena and provide an alternative to storing things in a physical location. The cloud is a way to connect to several servers and lease part of an application or software service.<br>
      As mentioned, both provide a similar service however, they are used very differently. A physical server provides a space upon which a single business or person can use for their own needs. This is often very helpful for large businesses that require high levels of security and have a need for a high bandwidth due to steady, heavy demand.<br>
      Cloud services allow users to access data or applications on the go and pay much lower amounts than a physical server. Now there are many ways of accessing cloud data and cloud computing offers a variety of different things as a ‘service’.  Some of the more basic operations include, software-as-a-service (SaaS) which often involves the leasing of software for a price.<br>
       This is mainly because any specific user will only pay for what ‘space’ they utilise and are usually rented at low costs. One main example of this system is Microsoft Office’s 365. The second of these is Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS). IaaS involves delivering everything from operating systems to servers and storage through special IP-based connectivity.<br>
      A main example of this is Microsoft Azure, something which RMIT uses to lease students large and expensive programs for free. The third type is Platform-as-a-service (PaaS). PaaS is considered the most complex of the three and shares similarities with Saas. PaaS however provides a platform for creating software that is then to be delivered via the internet. An example of this is a platform such as Salesforce.com<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-cloud-computing-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-cloud/">[2]</a>.<br>
       Likely in the next few years cloud computing is expected to boom. More than 1/3 of enterprise IT spending is related to cloud services and it is only expected to grow, in the last 5 years it has grown 20% and is expected to be worth a massive $260bn by 2021<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-cloud-computing-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-cloud/">[2]</a>. State of the art technology in the cloud computing area varies and is always growing.<br>
      A few examples are community clouds, big data clouds and multiclouds. A community cloud is a multi-tenant platform which allows multiple companies to work on the same platform as they all have similar desires. This may mean multiple companies are wishing to use the same application, instead of giving each person their own individual server they all work from the same one while their sessions are split into separate segments.</p>

    <h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>

    <p>Cloud based services and servers offer something to an average user that they would not normally be able to afford if they were relying on its physical relative. This allows small-medium businesses or individuals to host servers at a much lower cost as well as with less IT knowledge required, especially if people choose software-as-a-service.<br>
       The ever-growing need of on demand cloud services will create jobs as IT professionals will need to maintain the ‘cloud’. These numbers could become so large that around 800,000 jobs could be created over the next 5 years<a href="https://www.collabera.com/find-a-job/career-resources/how-will-cloud-computing-affect-it-jobs/">[3]</a>.<br>
      All these jobs will be related to data management, an integral part of cloud services. Some of these jobs include but are not limited to: data mining and statistical analysis, web architecture and development as well as cybersecurity analysts. All these will have major influence on people wishing to study in the IT field and unsure of what to choose.<br>
       By looking at the cloud computing area there are going to be many available jobs to people with the right technical skills and training. It could however make some positions redundant as there may be less need to work on and maintain physical servers. Online cloud services could have huge impacts and are likely to change the lives of many people. As cloud servers become bigger and more popular, they may begin to make physical servers more redundant.<br>
      A physical server requires a lot of things that newer cloud servers do not, some of these things are extremely important and can make work a lot easier to do. As cloud servers are virtually always online (Google promises a 99.9% uptime on servers <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/microsoft-365/business/microsoft-365-for-business-support-options/">[4]</a>) there is no downtime to update or backup things that are on a server.<br>
      Furthermore, a cloud server has data backed up and can be accessed by any worker or employee at any time without a need for a physical connection.</p>

    <h2>How will this affect you?</h2>
    <p>Cloud services provide on demand access to an extremely large variety of things for people daily. For people who are not in professional fields such as myself and my friends, cloud services will not provide as much of a benefit as they may for some others. Mainly for us it will be used to backup, store data and access applications easily and quickly rather than physical hard drives. For small businesses however, this provides a huge upside in terms of how data is stored and processed.<br>
       All data for a business can now be stored in the cloud and can be accessed by anyone, anywhere. Similarly, applications used within the business such as accounting programs and package suits can be accessed at low cost and a relatively low IT knowledge level. By utilising multiclouds or SaaS small to medium businesses can access programs and software on demand for a fraction of the cost and much easier use than storing things on a specific server.<br>
      Furthermore, it provides safe storage of data which is encrypted by the service provider making it difficult to be corrupted. Most companies that offer cloud services nowadays practice extremely good security on your data so an average business or individual will be protected well. For example, data is all encrypted when saved to the cloud and often bigger companies are starting to practice redundancy on your data.<br>
      This implies that your data is stored in multiple locations so if a particular server goes down your data will still be accessible and safe elsewhere. All these factors are extremely important in a small business and allow for easier and more cost-efficient solutions to people with minimal IT knowledge.</p>

  <h1>Cyber security</h1>

<h2>What does it do?</h2>
<p>Cyber security is the act of shielding PCs, workers, cell phones, electronic frameworks, organizations, and information from malevolent assaults. It's otherwise called data innovation security or electronic data security. The term applies in an assortment of settings, from business to versatile registering, and can be separated into a couple of regular classifications. In this current day and age, there are a number of things that cyber security can do. For instance:<br>

· Network security is the act of making sure about a PC network from interlopers, regardless of whether focused aggressors or sharp malware.

· Application security centers around keeping programming and gadgets liberated from dangers. An undermined application could give admittance to the information it's intended to secure. Fruitful security starts in the plan stage, certainly before a program or gadget is conveyed.

· Information security ensures the respectability and protection of information, both away and on the way.

· Operational security incorporates the cycles and choices for dealing with and ensuring information resources. The consents clients have while getting to an organization and the techniques that decide how and where information might be put away or shared all fall under this umbrella.

· Disaster recuperation and business progression characterize how an association reacts to a cyber-security occurrence or whatever other occasion that causes the loss of tasks or information. Debacle recuperation arrangements direct how the association reestablishes its tasks and data to re-visitation of a similar working limit as before the occasion. Business progression is the arrangement the association swears by while attempting to work without specific assets.

· End-client instruction addresses the most erratic cyber-security factor: individuals. Anybody can unintentionally acquire an infection with a generally secure framework by neglecting to follow great security rehearsals. Instructing clients to erase dubious email connections, not plug in unidentified USB drives, and different other significant exercises is fundamental for the security of any association.

The future of cybersecurity will have a hefty spotlight on utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) to make sure about gadgets and frameworks in the undeniably associated world. ... Fit mechanized frameworks that can screen, identify, oversee, and forestall cyber assaults continuously will be what drives cybersecurity going ahead.
</p>

<h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>
<p>An absence of spotlight on cyber security can be significantly harming to a business. There is the direct monetary expense of such assaults to the business, for example, robbery of corporate data, interruption to exchanging or in any event, fixing influenced frameworks all subsequent in budgetary misfortune. Just as the physical effect, cyber security breaks can likewise cause reputational harm.<br>
  With an absence of confidence in the security of the influenced business, clients will be more disposed to wander somewhere else, bringing about lost deals and benefits. Beside the immediate effects of a cyber security break, there are likewise legitimate outcomes to manage in the result. Inability to deal with a client's very own data considering the ongoing GDPR can bring about administrative approvals.<br>
  This is whether or not the carelessness starts from the administration or representatives of a business. All organizations, regardless of its size, need to guarantee everybody associated with the organization is exceptional on the most recent cyber security dangers and the best strategies for ensuring information.<br>
  The most ideal approach to do this is with normal preparation of staff just as utilizing a system to move in the direction of with key objectives for accomplishing a standard which guarantees the danger of an information break is negligible. One such norm, sponsored by the National Cyber Security Center, is Cyber Essentials organizations can get an accreditation for.</p>

<h2>How will this affect you?</h2>

<p>I feel like without cyber security, it would affect my life greatly. Since the current state of the world relies on the internet, we tend to store our information on the internet. Such as social media accounts or bank apps, without cybersecurity, hackers could just enter and grab our details without us knowing. Cyber threats are a big deal.<br>
   Cyber attacks can cause electrical blackouts, failure of military equipment and breaches of national security secrets. They can result in the theft of valuable, sensitive data like medical records. They can disrupt phone and computer networks or paralyze systems, making data unavailable.

<h1>Autonomous vehicles</h1s>
<h2>What does it do?</h2>

<p>For the means of transportation, one major way is the use of vehicles which has been going on for a long time. However one of the drawbacks is that it causes road carnages or road accidents leading to the losing of the lives of approximately one million people every year. Countermeasures such as introducing traffic lights and officers to regulate road traffic and Autonomous vehicles is one of the solutions.<br>
  “Autonomous vehicles or also called self-driving cars is a vehicle that can navigate itself without the need for a human driver, and get to its predetermined destination.” Although this technology currently has not reached the point of fully autonomous cars. There are 6 levels of Automation in autonomous vehicles classified by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE International), ‘0’ being fully manual and ‘6’ being fully autonomous (driver not required at all times).<br>
   Level 2: also known as partial hands off, ‘the car can control the acceleration, braking and steering without drivers.’ That said, self-driving cars and automated cars are a bit different, self-driving cars fall on the Level 3 as they still need to be assisted by a driver to take over at any time. Whereelse, fully automated cars fall in the level 5 (Full automation) which can operate without a driver.<bR>
  By the help of sensors(radars), GPS mapping and cameras, automated cars are able to monitor the surroundings and detect obstacles e.g people, other vehicles and traffic signs to find out the fastest and safest route to the destination. The state of the art of this technology has achieved up to level 2 and 3 where vehicles can drive itself but it is not 100% safe.<br>
  For example Lvl 2: Tesla Autopilot and Lvl 3: Audi Traffic Jam Pilot and no such cars for Lvl 5 exist yet however there is a driverless-car project by Google. For what this Technology can achieve in the near future, European Road Transport Research Advisory (ERTRAC) claims to have ‘automated shuttles and buses on dedicated roads backstopped by remote control centers by 2024 and will be fully automated by 2030.’<br>
  They also claimed that Ford’s geo-fenced Lvl 4 AV will be available by 2021 for personal purchase however the released date is vague. Geo-fenced is the ability for AVs to self-drive within a geographic area or on a specific road type e.g freeway. Other technologies that AV uses to make it possible are such as ‘lidar, a laser mapping technology which is very expensive; it is used to detect light, measure the distances and identify lane markings by bouncing pulses of light off the car’s surroundings.’  AVs also rely on other techs like sensors, actuators and complex algorithms or powerful processors to function accordingly and execute software.</p>

<h2>What is the likely impact? </h2>

<p>Automated cars and self-driving cars can have both positive negative impacts on the environment. Currently, only self-driving cars are officially released but there is still a long way to go for fully autonomous or automated cars. However, when they do introduce the Level 5 (Full automation) reliable and safety proof vehicles, due to the help of these mobiles there will be fewer road accidents leading to fewer traffic policies, better traffic flow as people are no longer driving.<br>
   AIs and vehicles will always follow traffic laws and help reduce the occurrence of traffic jams. This also helps limit the usage of money in the case of being lost finding a destination as the vehicle can find the best possible route and park the car accurately. ‘With full potential of autonomous cars, vehicle automation, vehicle electrification, and ridesharing unleashed: by 2050 there will be 30% fewer traffic congestions, 40% lesser transportation costs and reduction of urban CO2 emissions by 80%.’<br>
   The cons of the autonomous vehicles is that its full potential has not been reached yet. As of now, the most applicable product for autonomous vehicles are AVs by Tesla. Which only has 3rd Level of driving automation (Level 2). First up, it is very expensive for it has made use of expensive technologies in making and designing one. In addition, it is still just a machine which without perfecting, has tendencies to have errors which might potentially lead to life threatening accidents to either to the passenger or the pedestrians. There are a lot of challenges to overcome even accidents caused due to the potential stupidity of the persona. For example, consumers and owners not acknowledging the capabilities and limitations of the driving automation Levels the vehicles support and using as it has higher levels of automation.<br>
  cvuyFor example crashes/accidents where an owner of a Tesla vehicle on Autopilot was playing a video game or shooting a pornographic film in a Tesla that is driving on Autopilot.</p>

<h2>How will this affect you?</h2>

<p>Personally for me and my friends AVs of level 2 driving automation like Tesla will have no effect on our lives as we for one are not willing to spend large amounts of money on transportation plus I have not driving experience. In the perspective of walkability and livability for the case of fully automated cars as most of my means are transportation are by feet and trams so it will be a safer environment as it will reduce chances of traffic carnage and car accidents.<br>
   The other advantages of fully automated cars are that the elderly and physically disabled people or handicapped individuals will be able to drive by themselves. However, back in my home country I mainly use cars and with fully automated cars and improved traffic policies especially not allowing cars to park anywhere on the side of the roads, there will be a huge decrease in wasted time commuting and being stuck in traffic congestions and way fewer car accidents.<br>
    Everyone in my hometown is just J-walking all over the place, pedestrians popping out breaking traffic policies in the fault of both drivers for not driving under speed limit and pedestrians not crossing the road in a safer method.</p>

<h1>Robots</h1>
<h2>What does it do?</h2>
<p>The robotic arm was first developed in 1964 by two men named George Devol and Joe Engleberger. Since then, robotics has expanded and improved as they have further integrated it into the everyday life of humans all around the world. In simple terms, a robot is a machine that operates autonomously and is generally used to replace human works and efforts.<br>
   Since the robotic arm was implemented by the large company, General Motors, in the 1960’s, manufacturers around the world have begun replacing human workers with machinery. As the development of robotics increases, more and more jobs are at risk of being replaced by the likes of robots, providing more automation, and in most cases, greater productivity and the incurrence of less costs.<br>
   Currently, robots can be seen all around us, from basic robots such as toys for children, and going all the way through to advanced robots working alongside skilled doctors to assist in precise surgery situations, that would otherwise be impossible for the human hands and eyes to complete.
   During this year, more significant breakthroughs continue to be announced, with the National University of Singapore announcing the development of an electronic ‘skin’ that has the ability to detect and respond to touch 1000 times faster than that of the human nervous system. The artificial skin also has the ability to differentiate between different textures, hardness, and shape with a very high accuracy.<br>
  Moving forward from this breakthrough invention, researchers at the university aim to equip human-like androids and other prosthetics with this electronic skin so that they can collaborate with humans in an effective and natural manner. Another breakthrough development is the creation of nanobots. They have been used for mainly medical use in the bloodstream.<br>
  Scientists from both China’s National Center for Nanoscience and Technology (NCNT), as well as from Arizona State University, both claim to have developed mini nanorobots that are only a few hundred nanometers across. This is groundbreaking considering there are 25 million nanometers in one inch. Scientists hope that once the nanobots enter the bloodstream, they will be able to successfully perform life saving procedures such as shrinking tumors, injecting drugs with unmatched precision, and destroying cancer cells. In the future, scientists have stated that the nanobots will be able to find tissue damage, monitor diseases, and destroy plaques in our blood vessels.
</p>

<h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>

<p>The development of robots also plays alongside the development and curation of artificial intelligence (AI). With the continued development of artificial intelligence and the ability of machines to learn and retain information through interactions, the future of life-like robots who can hold human conversations is not as far away as some might think. According to research conducted by the U.S. Army Research Laboratory, autonomous machines in the future may operate and build trust through emotion with humans. Researchers at the laboratory claim that actions and other nonverbal signals will be a primary contributor in promoting cooperation between humans and robotic AI. For example, smiling after mutual cooperation with a robot will inspire further cooperation in the future. This will allow humans and robots to communicate in a non-verbal manner, potentially opening up a vast array of different uses.<br>
For example, in military use, non-verbal communication could be used in operation scenarios where noise cannot be made. Technology such as this being integrated into a robot with electronic skin is paving the way for advanced intelligent robots who we may be coexisting with in the near future.
In regards to nanobots, the effect these tiny robots will have will be felt immensely world wide. The massive amount of money spent on running hospitals, developing medication and procedures, may see decreases of over 50% once this technology becomes mass produced. The creation of nanobots for medical use also brings to light the idea of these nanobots being used in more areas than just medical.<br>
In the future, nanobots could be used to build infrastructure. Theoretically, nanobots could be programmed to come together to form massive structures, potentially through the use of magnets. However, in our current time,
</p>

<h2>How will this affect you?</h2>

<p>The continued development of robots will most likely affect me in the same manner as it affects most individuals around the world, and that is the inevitable takeover of robots in the workplace. Manufacturing, medical, finance, military, and other popular fields will gradually be replaced by robots who not only save companies money, but also boost productivity by massive amounts due to the speed and precision that robots and machines can operate at.<br>
   Simply leaving humans incapable of matching a robot’s capabilities. However, in the future, robots may provide assistance to humans in simple everyday tasks such as brushing your teeth and cooking dinner for the family. Potentially, as robots evolve, society as we live in today may be almost unrecognizable. Workspaces may prove to be quite dull, where there was once a large assembly of people socially interacting with each other to reach a goal, there soon could be a lifeless automated workspace where the only noises heard are the clunking and churning of robots in operation.
The use of nanobots for medical purposes will not only positively affect me, but also every individual around the world. The success of this technology could revolutionise the entire planet. Vast amounts of money used to fund hospitals and research could be minimised as the nanobots will be able to replace a vast majority of procedures. Millions of lives would be saved every year. Preventing and curing terminals illnesses that were once a death sentence.<br>
 Through mass production, nanobots are predicted to be affordable to the general public sometime after their initial release, further releasing families from the financial burden of having a loved one treated for life threatening illnesses. The increase in the use of robots for medical to industrial purposes will further lead us into the Internet of Things. The Internet of Things establishes that all objects are connected to a network cloud, and therefore everything is interconnected.<br>
  Using nanobots within the bloodstream to help diseases would increase medical knowledge as the nanobot would be communicating with other medical technologies outside of the patient, leading to more efficient treatment of diseases and injuries. However, medical purposes will not be in the only place that benefits from the connectedness of all objects, this would follow through towards industrial practices, transport, and even mundane chores. Therefore, with the ever evolving science behind robotics expanding at an alarming rate, it is only a matter of time till the whole world is affected by the increased use of technology and robotics, for the better. The result would be a more intertwined and efficient society.
