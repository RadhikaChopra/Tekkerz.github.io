  <h1>Cloud, services, servers</h1>
  <h2>What does it do? </h2>
    <p>Cloud services, and servers is a very broad area relating to data transfer and storage through either a physical or virtual server. Both services are a way to process and store data in varying applications. State of the art technology for both types vary and are classified by many factors e.g. Size of storage, cybersecurity, speed, and ease of access.<br>
       Physical servers have been around now for a long period of time and are used to store anything from data to media all the way down to web servers. Cloud servers are however a much newer phenomena and provide an alternative to storing things in a physical location. The cloud is a way to connect to several servers and lease part of an application or software service.<br>
      As mentioned, both provide a similar service however, they are used very differently. A physical server provides a space upon which a single business or person can use for their own needs. This is often very helpful for large businesses that require high levels of security and have a need for a high bandwidth due to steady, heavy demand.<br>
      Cloud services allow users to access data or applications on the go and pay much lower amounts than a physical server. Now there are many ways of accessing cloud data and cloud computing offers a variety of different things as a ‘service’.  Some of the more basic operations include, software-as-a-service (SaaS) which often involves the leasing of software for a price.<br>
       This is mainly because any specific user will only pay for what ‘space’ they utilise and are usually rented at low costs. One main example of this system is Microsoft Office’s 365. The second of these is Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS). IaaS involves delivering everything from operating systems to servers and storage through special IP-based connectivity.<br>
      A main example of this is Microsoft Azure, something which RMIT uses to lease students large and expensive programs for free. The third type is Platform-as-a-service (PaaS). PaaS is considered the most complex of the three and shares similarities with Saas. PaaS however provides a platform for creating software that is then to be delivered via the internet. An example of this is a platform such as Salesforce.com<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-cloud-computing-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-cloud/">[2]</a>.<br>
       Likely in the next few years cloud computing is expected to boom. More than 1/3 of enterprise IT spending is related to cloud services and it is only expected to grow, in the last 5 years it has grown 20% and is expected to be worth a massive $260bn by 2021<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-cloud-computing-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-cloud/">[2]</a>. State of the art technology in the cloud computing area varies and is always growing.<br>
      A few examples are community clouds, big data clouds and multiclouds. A community cloud is a multi-tenant platform which allows multiple companies to work on the same platform as they all have similar desires. This may mean multiple companies are wishing to use the same application, instead of giving each person their own individual server they all work from the same one while their sessions are split into separate segments.</p>

    <h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>

    <p>Cloud based services and servers offer something to an average user that they would not normally be able to afford if they were relying on its physical relative. This allows small-medium businesses or individuals to host servers at a much lower cost as well as with less IT knowledge required, especially if people choose software-as-a-service.<br>
       The ever-growing need of on demand cloud services will create jobs as IT professionals will need to maintain the ‘cloud’. These numbers could become so large that around 800,000 jobs could be created over the next 5 years<a href="https://www.collabera.com/find-a-job/career-resources/how-will-cloud-computing-affect-it-jobs/">[3]</a>.<br>
      All these jobs will be related to data management, an integral part of cloud services. Some of these jobs include but are not limited to: data mining and statistical analysis, web architecture and development as well as cybersecurity analysts. All these will have major influence on people wishing to study in the IT field and unsure of what to choose.<br>
       By looking at the cloud computing area there are going to be many available jobs to people with the right technical skills and training. It could however make some positions redundant as there may be less need to work on and maintain physical servers. Online cloud services could have huge impacts and are likely to change the lives of many people. As cloud servers become bigger and more popular, they may begin to make physical servers more redundant.<br>
      A physical server requires a lot of things that newer cloud servers do not, some of these things are extremely important and can make work a lot easier to do. As cloud servers are virtually always online (Google promises a 99.9% uptime on servers <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/microsoft-365/business/microsoft-365-for-business-support-options/">[4]</a>) there is no downtime to update or backup things that are on a server.<br>
      Furthermore, a cloud server has data backed up and can be accessed by any worker or employee at any time without a need for a physical connection.</p>

    <h2>How will this affect you?</h2>
    <p>Cloud services provide on demand access to an extremely large variety of things for people daily. For people who are not in professional fields such as myself and my friends, cloud services will not provide as much of a benefit as they may for some others. Mainly for us it will be used to backup, store data and access applications easily and quickly rather than physical hard drives. For small businesses however, this provides a huge upside in terms of how data is stored and processed.<br>
       All data for a business can now be stored in the cloud and can be accessed by anyone, anywhere. Similarly, applications used within the business such as accounting programs and package suits can be accessed at low cost and a relatively low IT knowledge level. By utilising multiclouds or SaaS small to medium businesses can access programs and software on demand for a fraction of the cost and much easier use than storing things on a specific server.<br>
      Furthermore, it provides safe storage of data which is encrypted by the service provider making it difficult to be corrupted. Most companies that offer cloud services nowadays practice extremely good security on your data so an average business or individual will be protected well. For example, data is all encrypted when saved to the cloud and often bigger companies are starting to practice redundancy on your data.<br>
      This implies that your data is stored in multiple locations so if a particular server goes down your data will still be accessible and safe elsewhere. All these factors are extremely important in a small business and allow for easier and more cost-efficient solutions to people with minimal IT knowledge.</p>

  <h1>Cyber security</h1>

<h2>What does it do?</h2>
<p>Cyber security is the act of shielding PCs, workers, cell phones, electronic frameworks, organizations, and information from malevolent assaults. It's otherwise called data innovation security or electronic data security. The term applies in an assortment of settings, from business to versatile registering, and can be separated into a couple of regular classifications. In this current day and age, there are a number of things that cyber security can do. For instance:<br>

· Network security is the act of making sure about a PC network from interlopers, regardless of whether focused aggressors or sharp malware.

· Application security centers around keeping programming and gadgets liberated from dangers. An undermined application could give admittance to the information it's intended to secure. Fruitful security starts in the plan stage, certainly before a program or gadget is conveyed.

· Information security ensures the respectability and protection of information, both away and on the way.

· Operational security incorporates the cycles and choices for dealing with and ensuring information resources. The consents clients have while getting to an organization and the techniques that decide how and where information might be put away or shared all fall under this umbrella.

· Disaster recuperation and business progression characterize how an association reacts to a cyber-security occurrence or whatever other occasion that causes the loss of tasks or information. Debacle recuperation arrangements direct how the association reestablishes its tasks and data to re-visitation of a similar working limit as before the occasion. Business progression is the arrangement the association swears by while attempting to work without specific assets.

· End-client instruction addresses the most erratic cyber-security factor: individuals. Anybody can unintentionally acquire an infection with a generally secure framework by neglecting to follow great security rehearsals. Instructing clients to erase dubious email connections, not plug in unidentified USB drives, and different other significant exercises is fundamental for the security of any association.

The future of cybersecurity will have a hefty spotlight on utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) to make sure about gadgets and frameworks in the undeniably associated world. ... Fit mechanized frameworks that can screen, identify, oversee, and forestall cyber assaults continuously will be what drives cybersecurity going ahead.
</p>

<h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>
<p>An absence of spotlight on cyber security can be significantly harming to a business. There is the direct monetary expense of such assaults to the business, for example, robbery of corporate data, interruption to exchanging or in any event, fixing influenced frameworks all subsequent in budgetary misfortune. Just as the physical effect, cyber security breaks can likewise cause reputational harm.<br>
  With an absence of confidence in the security of the influenced business, clients will be more disposed to wander somewhere else, bringing about lost deals and benefits. Beside the immediate effects of a cyber security break, there are likewise legitimate outcomes to manage in the result. Inability to deal with a client's very own data considering the ongoing GDPR can bring about administrative approvals.<br>
  This is whether or not the carelessness starts from the administration or representatives of a business. All organizations, regardless of its size, need to guarantee everybody associated with the organization is exceptional on the most recent cyber security dangers and the best strategies for ensuring information.<br>
  The most ideal approach to do this is with normal preparation of staff just as utilizing a system to move in the direction of with key objectives for accomplishing a standard which guarantees the danger of an information break is negligible. One such norm, sponsored by the National Cyber Security Center, is Cyber Essentials organizations can get an accreditation for.</p>

<h2>How will this affect you?</h2>

<p>I feel like without cyber security, it would affect my life greatly. Since the current state of the world relies on the internet, we tend to store our information on the internet. Such as social media accounts or bank apps, without cybersecurity, hackers could just enter and grab our details without us knowing. Cyber threats are a big deal.<br>
   Cyber attacks can cause electrical blackouts, failure of military equipment and breaches of national security secrets. They can result in the theft of valuable, sensitive data like medical records. They can disrupt phone and computer networks or paralyze systems, making data unavailable.
