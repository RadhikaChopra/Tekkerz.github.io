<h1>Reflections</h1>

<h2>Individual</h1>

  <h2>Luke</h2>
<p>Overall I believe our team worked fairly well on the project. When work needed to be completed it was done so to a high standard and was almost always completed on time. Our group of six conducted three meetings over the entire duration of the project and allowed us to communicate ideas quickly and easily as well as decide what needed to be completed and by whom.<br>
   The document kept with a small agenda and minutes was successful as if people missed meetings they were still able to catch up on work in their own time. This will hopefully follow into A3 with the recordings of the meeting also proving very helpful. Something that could and will need to be improved for A3 will be starting work early.<br>
  As uni students we have a bad habit of leaving things until the last minute and this assignment was no different. If people were to begin earlier we need to stress less when the work gets close to submission time. Something I have learnt about groups is that they don’t always have to be bad! <br>
  Our group communicated well and everyone was very accepting of feedback and willing to rework solutions until the team was happy with them, something which you definitely don’t get in all group projects. </p>

<h2>Radhika</h2>
<p>Team Tekkerz was an interesting group to work with. In terms of content, we were able to assign work to each other and delegate fairly. Most of this work was completed within the specified time frame, and we were good at giving each other feedback and notes on improvement. I think one thing that could be improved would be overall communication.<br>
   It was disheartening at times to message the group and not hear back, especially close to deadline and as the person who had to build out the final product. One thing that surprised me was how easily we could compile information and collaborate over the Internet having never met in real life.<br>
  I think I much prefer face to face communication as I thrive off people’s creativity and energy, but having the documented notes and the meetings was really helpful. What I have learned about groups is that it can be difficult to make sure everyone is on task and able to understand their individual requirement, if you do not have a direct communication pathway.<br>
  Especially working online, you have to put a lot of trust in your team members and their expert skills to get to the end product. Technology can be a great helper, but you have to work around everyone’s schedule and that can make things harder. Compromise and working with people’s strengths is key to success.</p>

<h2>Xavier</h2>
<p>Overall I was happy with the way the group conducted themselves. Communication was sufficient enough to complete the assignment at an appropriate level, however, more communication could’ve been done to ensure all ambiguities were resolved. Meetings on Microsoft teams went smoothly with most people attending a majority of the meetings.<br>
   Work was split amongst each individual in the group. Ideas about the project were agreed upon by each member easily, as we all had similar views on what should occur. One thing that surprised me was how efficient programs such as Microsoft Teams and Google Docs make working in a group over the internet.<br>
  Work and ideas were easily shared amongst members, and feedback about  those ideas were given to each other quickly and effectively. After completing this assignment, I learnt that working in groups always has its difficulties, especially during Covid-19. <br>
  People may have completely different schedules and difficulties to maintain at this time, so working around that aspect in a group is always a challenge. However, as a whole, I believe our group worked very well together and should be proud of each other.</p>

<h2>Suhayb</h2>

<p>The most important thing that our group was able to do was complete the work that was required, and help each other with what needed to be completed. If something was not completed the others would call it out and remind the other person to complete it which is really good. Overall i believe the major issue that we faced was communication, the communication was good but not to an extent.<br>
   We could all benefit from attending the meetings more, I myself need to focus more on improving my communication. One thing that surprised me while working together in a group was how we shared each other's ideas and interests. While working together as a group I have learnt to communicate and finish my required works quickly and efficiently.<br>
  In conclusion I believe we have done a great job working together, while there are places we could improve we still managed to do great even in these rouch covid-19 times where we are stuck in houses and have to communicate online.</p>

<h2>Soe </h2>

<p>Overall, I think our group was easy to communicate our plans and assign works and separate them easily. Even though I was behind for this class and missed the assignment which was a very important piece as a work input that is used for A2, I was able to understand what needed to be done on my part by the help of the advice I got from my members during our meetings.<br>
   It was a little struggle to schedule a meeting as we are not campus but we still successfully got through the messages through MS. It was very easy to communicate and listen to other members' ideas and thoughts, planning was very simple. I believe we worked very well together as a team and managed to finish their own parts.<br>
  I was a bit later on filling my report due to some other assignments I was trying to catch up with and I hope I can finish my works faster in the coming A3. </p>
