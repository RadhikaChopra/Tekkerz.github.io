  <h1> Group Project</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2><br>
<p>Our project will involve a piece of hardware that could be built into water storage devices (Cattle troughs, tanks) to remotely assess the levels of water through an application to run on either a smart phone or computer. It will involve work with both hardware elements that will be used on site alongside an application to transmit data remotely and wirelessly. These features will allow people who live long distances from water sources such as farmers with bodies of water a long way from residences to check levels of water easily from a smartphone or computer rather than needing to physically check the source. This in turn will hopefully allow them to save time, money and allow solutions to be planned before problems occur (such as a drought).</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>Growing up on a rural property I know the struggle of having to constantly check and maintain water sources during the peak heat of summer. With an estimated 135,000 farming properties Australia wide, this product could be utilised by a huge range of people and would make it extremely viable due to harsh and contrasting weather conditions in rural Australia. Knowing this I believe this product provides an extremely interesting solution to a common problem in water storage. To fix such a problem would allow thousands of people to save time, money and resources majorly benefiting Australia’s agricultural industry hence my motivation as a possible future stakeholder.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>As mentioned previously the project would need to be split into two halves, software and hardware. The software side of the project would involve algorithms to calculate the actual water level and must also be able to then transmit those values to a receiver which will most likely be a desktop GUI or mobile application. The hardware side will require a device to be fitted inside a water storage device and would either use pressure sensing technology or a flotation device which could sense a specific water level. As the water level rises or falls the inbuilt computer has a microprocessor that can calculate the water level at any one point in time. This would require the device to be waterproof and able to withstand a certain amount of water pressure at any one time. To overcome this the device would be provided in a small air/watertight container and could be easily transported to any size water storage container as required. These different options of installation are offered as different packages and would suit different situations. The microcontroller within the package would utilise Visual Studio to create an algorithm based upon either the pressure that the vessel faces at a point in time or based upon the height of the buoyancy device. From there the device would then transmit the calculated data directly to the user no matter the distance from the storage device (Over extremely long distances this may require repeaters to be placed periodically to stop the signal from dropping out). Another option, (Although a little more costly) would be for users’ great distances from the tank to utilise satellite technology to transmit signals no matter the distance. This provides multiple options for both the hardware and software applications. The GUI would allow the device owner to easily track and monitor multiple different water storage devices at any one time. An alert system would notify the individual if a tank got below a certain level dictated by the user and relevant action could be taken. If the product were to gain more traction a phone application could be brought into place to allow users to check their data from anywhere as well as receive updates and warnings straight to their phone rather than to a desktop computer.</p>

<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
<p>For this project to be successful it would need aspects of both software and hardware. The hardware could utilise features of an Arduino or raspberry pi. Both devices have wireless transmitting capabilities and could also use their inbuilt chips to do calculations and find specific water values. Alongside this would be an inherent need for some software both in the calculations part and some way for the user to easily access this data. I believe this could be in the form of a basic GUI which could be programmed using MATLAB and easily accessible on desktop computers. If the project had vested interest from stakeholders, this could be converted to create a mobile application and allow people to access their data on the go.</p>

<h2>Skills Required</h2>
<p>There will be both software and hardware aspects to a project like this. The software would be split into two parts, the GUI/App and the code on the device measuring the water levels. The software required for this could be as simple as MATLAB or Visual Studio which are both more than capable of being able to write and solve complex algorithms. Furthermore, MATLAB has an inbuilt GUI designer and could also be used in conjunction with the code created to create a fully fledged app. This part of the project could be done easily by a large range of people and would not require any specialist skills. The design and implementation of the hardware however may prove to be more challenging. To begin the hardware would need to be sourced at as cheaper price as possible this may prove a challenge as some parts required such as the onboard transmitter and computer could be expensive. This would need to be carefully though about before diving in headfirst.</p>

<h2>Outcome</h2>
<p>If this project were to be successful it would provide an easy monitoring system for farmers all over Australia and perhaps even disadvantaged communities worldwide. It can save farmers lots of time and resources as well as a functionality that could be used worldwide to help monitor water storage levels on a small scale. This leads to a mountain of possibilities and absolutely solves a known problem, especially in the agricultural industry.
