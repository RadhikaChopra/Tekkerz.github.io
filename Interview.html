  Interview with an IT professional<br><br>
</div>

  <p>What kind of work is done by the IT professional?<br><br>
  They are a lead AI programmer and developer, they develop AI, VR experiences and mobile applications for their start-up company called PlayingForward. <br>
  They are currently developing an AR app for physical therapy.<br><br>

  What kinds of people do you interact with? Are they other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public?<br><br>
  I mostly interact with other developers and investors, people who are interested and willing to invest in our product. <br>
  Our company is still in itâ€™s start-up phase so at the moment I would probably say that I communicate with investors most at the moment.<br><br>

  Where do you spend most of your time?<br><br>
  Given this pandemic state I am currently working from home, I work remotely. <br>
  For the most part my work entails a lot of coding & programming with the occasional work meeting.<br>
  Prior to the pandemic I had to bounce between America and Australia quite a lot as we have investors in the US with our own offices there as well.<br><br>

  What aspects of your position do you find most challenging?<br><br>

  Coming up with solutions to problems, working with cutting edge technology without any documentation to help whatsoever.<br><br></p>
